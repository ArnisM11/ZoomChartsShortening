# ZoomChartsShortening

There are long and short forms of numbers. For example, 10000 can also be written as 10 K, or 100000000 can be written as 100 M.
Write a "value shortening" JavaScript function which converts a raw number into an appropriate shortened number and shortened unit, and create an appropriate suite of tests verifying this function behaves as expected. For the purpose of this exercise, the function should simply return an object containing the relevant value and valueUnit.

To run the unit tests : 
1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the tests using "npm test" command.
